// Objects
// An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method

// const Person = {
//   name: "Shubham",
//   age: 21,
// };

// console.log(typeof Person);

const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(typeof arr);

// date is an object;
const date = new Date();
console.log(typeof date);
